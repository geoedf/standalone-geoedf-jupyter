# GeoEDF standalone deployment in JupyterHub

This repository contains files to build a single user container image for JupyterHub 
that includes a standalone deployment of GeoEDF where workflows are run in a local HTCondor pool.

The repository also includes a *config.yml* file for configuring a JupyterHub deployment where 
the standalone GeoEDF user container is used.
